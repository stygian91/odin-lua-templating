# What?
This is an Odin port of John Schember's small Lua template renderer, described in this article: https://nachtimwald.com/2014/08/06/using-lua-as-a-templating-engine/

Supports:
 * `{{ var }}` for printing variables.
 * `{% func }}` for running Lua functions (and code blocks in general).

Use `\{` to use a literal `{` in the template.

Multi-line strings in Lua blocks are supported but
 `[[` is not allowed. Use `[=[` or some other variation.
